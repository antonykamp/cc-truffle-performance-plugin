name: profiling-with-cpu-sampler
description: Time-based sampling profiler showing WHERE execution time is spent (wall-clock time, not frequency). Provides histogram with self/total time, compilation tiers (T0/T1/T2), and flame graphs. Use as FIRST step to identify hot functions consuming most time. Low overhead, suitable for longer runs. Pair with tracing-execution-counts to understand time-per-execution vs execution frequency.

# Profiling with CPU Sampler

Time-based sampling profiler that identifies WHERE your program spends execution time. Shows wall-clock time distribution across functions with compilation tier breakdown.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use FIRST** when investigating any performance issue:
- Identify hot functions consuming most time
- Verify code is compiling (tier distribution)
- Measure time spent in interpreter vs compiled code
- Generate flame graphs for visualization

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic profiling
<launcher> --cpusampler <program>

# With tier breakdown (RECOMMENDED)
<launcher> --cpusampler --cpusampler.ShowTiers=true <program>

# Skip warmup (recommended for steady-state analysis)
<launcher> --cpusampler --cpusampler.Delay=5000 --cpusampler.ShowTiers=true <program>
```

## ⚠️ REQUIRED: Fermi Verification (Every Tool Invocation)

**Before running**:
- [ ] Pre-calculate: Expected hot functions (1-5 names), T0/T1/T2 split
- [ ] Smoke test: `<launcher> --cpusampler -c 'print 1;'` → Verify output format

**After running**:
- [ ] Validate: Actual vs estimate within 1 order of magnitude? YES / NO
- [ ] If NO: **STOP** - Debug tool before proceeding (run `--help:cpusampler`, test on known-good input)
- [ ] Save output: `tool-outputs/cpu-sampler-[benchmark].txt`

**Gate**: All boxes checked? → Proceed to analysis

## Key Options

| Option | Description | Recommended Value |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| `--cpusampler.ShowTiers=true` | Show T0/T1/T2 breakdown | **Always use** |
| `--cpusampler.Delay=<ms>` | Skip warmup | 2000-10000 |
| `--cpusampler.Period=<ms>` | Sample interval | 10 (default) |
| `--cpusampler.Output=calltree` | Output format | Default: histogram |
| `--cpusampler.OutputFile=<file>` | Save to file | For later analysis |
| `--cpusampler.SampleInternal=true` | Include internal frames | For Truffle debugging |

## Understanding Output

### Tier Columns

| Tier | Meaning | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| T0 | Interpreter | <10% for hot functions |
| T1 | First-tier compiled | Transitional |
| T2 | Fully optimized | >80% for hot functions |

### Sample Output

```
Sampling Histogram. Recorded 412 samples with period 10ms.
  Self Time: Time spent in function (excluding callees)
  Total Time: Time in function including callees

Name          || Total Time   || Self Time    || T0    | T1   | T2
queens        || 1850ms 88.0% || 1850ms 88.0% || 5.2%  | 3.1% | 91.7%
hasConflict   || 250ms 11.9%  || 250ms 11.9%  || 8.8%  | 4.2% | 87.0%
```

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Good Performance
- ✅ Hot functions show >80% T2 time
- ✅ <10% T0 (interpreter) time
- ✅ Time concentrated in expected hot functions

### Performance Problems
- ⚠️ >30% T0 time → Compilation issues
- ⚠️ High T1 but low T2 → Optimization barriers
- ⚠️ Time in unexpected functions → Algorithm issues
